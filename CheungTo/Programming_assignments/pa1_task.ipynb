        "\n",
        "After loading the datasets, the first step is to preprocess them to ensure high-quality data (Total: 1.25 points).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Idea Behind Quantile Normalization\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantile normalization is a standardization technique that ensures different datasets follow the same distribution. It is widely used in microarray data analysis, where the expression levels of genes are compared across different samples. The goal is to make the distributions of the datasets similar to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Key Definitions\n",
        "**Quantile Normalization**: A standardization technique that ensures different datasets follow the same distribution by:\n",
        "1. Creating a reference distribution from column means\n",
        "2. Mapping original values to this reference using ranks\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rank Definition**: \n",
        "- The position index if values were sorted in ascending order (0-based)\n",
        "- For values in a row: lowest value → rank 0, next → rank 1, etc.\n",
        "- Example: Values [3, 1, 4] → Ranks [1, 0, 2]\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Overall Steps\n",
        "Quantile normalization involves 3 steps:\n",
        "1. **Calculate Rank Matrix**: Rank each row of the input dataset (say, *X*) from lowest to highest and obtain the ranking of each value (not the ranked dataset). (0.5 points, helper function: `calculate_rank`)\n",
        "2. **Create Reference Distribution**: Create a reference distribution of the input dataset from lowest to highest, then calculate the mean value of each **column**. (0.25 points, helper function: `calculate_mean`)\n",
        "3. **Value Substitution**: For each value in the array *X* with rank *i* (obtained from the `calculate_rank` function), substitute it with `mean[i]` (where `mean` is obtained from the `calculate_mean` function). (0.25 points, helper function: `substitute_mean`)\n",
        "\n",
        "Then you will need to use these helper functions to complete the preprocessing (0.25 points, function: `quantile_normalization`).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Visual Example\n",
        "Here is an example to help you understand the process:\n",
        "```python\n",
